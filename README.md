# Installation

    git clone https://github.com/drduh/pwd.sh && cd pwd.sh

Requires `gpg`. Install with `brew install gpg` or `sudo apt-get install gnupg` or build and install it from [source](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html).

# Use

Run the script interactively with `./pwd.sh`

Type `w` to write a password.

Type `r` to read a password(s).

Type `c` to copy a password to the clipboard (mac only).

Type `d` to delete a password.

Options can also be passed on the command line. Here are some examples:

`./pwd.sh w gmail 30` to create a password for 'gmail' with a length of 30 characters. Append `<space>q` to suppress password output.

`./pwd.sh r user@github` to read the password for 'user@github'.

`./pwd.sh d dropbox` to delete the password for 'dropbox'.

Combine with other programs by piping output, e.g.,

`./pwd.sh r github | grep github | cut -f1 -d ' ' | pbcopy` to copy a password to clipboard on OS X.

The script and `pwd.sh.safe` encrypted file can be safely shared between machines over public channels (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc).

A sample `gpg.conf` configuration file is provided for your consideration.
